package io.netty.channel;



/**
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *
 * <h3>Release resources</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is important to call {@link #close()} or {@link #close(ChannelPromise)} to release all
 * resources once you are done with the {@link Channel}. This ensures all resources are
 * released in a proper way, i.e. filehandles.
